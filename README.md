# About me
I'm Zander Little, a student of Computer Science at WSU. I spend most of my free time off the computer playing D&D with friends, working on my old broken down 2000 VW Golf, and 3D printing (I have a modified voxelab aquila running a Creality 4.2.7 motherboard, and a stock Elegoo Mars 3 pro).
